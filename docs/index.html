		<article><div><h1>From 42 to Full-Stack Development</h1><p><img alt="42 logo" src="/SSG_Static-Site-Generator/images/42.png" /></p><p>Hi, I'm Thibault — a full-stack web developer trained at <a href="https://42.fr/en/homepage/">École 42</a>, an intensive and peer-led programming school built on autonomy, resilience, and project-based learning.</p><p>At 42, there are no teachers, no traditional courses — just real-world coding challenges tackled through collaboration and experimentation. Over the course of the program, I went from writing memory-safe C libraries to deploying full-stack applications with authentication, real-time features, and containerized services. This experience not only shaped my technical foundation but also taught me how to learn fast, adapt, and ship working software under pressure.</p><h2>Why 42?</h2><ul><li>Peer-to-peer learning: progress through collaboration, not instruction</li><li>Real projects: every milestone mimics real-world development</li><li>Autonomy: you manage your time, your work, and your learning</li><li>Resilience: it’s intense — and that’s the point</li></ul><p>42 isn't just a school, it's a professional bootcamp that shapes developers ready for real challenges.</p><h2>Projects I’m proud of</h2><ol><li>🎮 <b>ft_transcendence</b> – A full-stack multiplayer Pong game (SPA) with Django, custom router, chat & OAuth2 - <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge/42-Cursus__Ft-Transcendence">repository</a></li><li>🐚 <b>minishell</b> – A custom shell with process handling, pipes, and signals - <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge/42-Cursus__Minishell">repository</a></li><li>🧱 <b>Cub3d</b> – A raycasting-based 3D game engine in C, inspired by <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>, with custom map parsing, texture mapping, and basic physics – <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge/42-Cursus__Cub3d">repository</a></li><li>🧠 <b>push_swap</b> – Sorting algorithm visualizer optimized for minimal instruction sets <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge/42-Cursus__Push_Swap">repository</a></li><li>📦 <b>pipex</b>, <b>libft</b>, <b>philo</b>, <b>ft_printf</b> – Low-level C tools built from scratch</li></ol><h2>Blog</h2><ul><li><a href="/SSG_Static-Site-Generator/blog/breakingbad">Breaking Bad and the Art of Long-Term Storytelling in Code & TV</a></li><li><a href="/SSG_Static-Site-Generator/blog/stories">3 funny tech stories</a></li></ul><h2>Get in touch</h2><ul><li>🌐 <a href="https://thibault-deverge.vercel.app/">Portfolio</a></li><li>💻 <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge">GitHub</a></li><li>🧑‍💼 <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/thibault-deverge">LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p>---</p><p>This site was generated with a static site generator I built in Python, can find more about it <a href="https://github.com/thibault-deverge/SSG_Static-Site-Generator">here</a></p></div></article>
