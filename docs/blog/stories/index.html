		<article><div><h1>3 True (and Slightly Absurd) Tech Stories</h1><p><a href="/SSG_Static-Site-Generator/">back home</a></p><p><img alt="meme" src="/SSG_Static-Site-Generator/images/meme.png" /></p><p>Technology is full of brilliant ideas, but also surprising mistakes. Here are three real-world stories that show just how weird — and costly — things can get in tech.</p><p>---</p><h2>1. The Mars Rover That Crashed Because of Units</h2><p>In 1999, NASA lost the <b>Mars Climate Orbiter</b>, a \$125 million spacecraft, because of a simple unit mismatch. One team used <b>imperial units</b> (pound-seconds), while another used <b>metric</b> (newton-seconds). The result? A miscalculated trajectory that made the probe descend too low into Mars’ atmosphere, where it disintegrated.</p><p>This wasn’t a software bug — it was a human coordination bug. The failure became a classic case study in why documentation, testing, and communication matter.</p><blockquote>Source: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-01-mn-17288-story.html">NASA's Metric Mishap</a></blockquote><p>---</p><h2>2. The Amazon Pricing Bot War</h2><p>In 2011, two automated pricing bots on Amazon got locked in a loop. One bot was set to <b>price a book slightly higher than its competitor</b>, while the other tried to <b>undercut it by just a bit</b>.</p><p>The feedback loop led to the price of a biology book, <i>"The Making of a Fly"</i>, hitting <b>\$23,698,655.93</b> (plus shipping). The madness was only noticed when a curious user tweeted a screenshot. Needless to say, manual intervention was required.</p><blockquote>Source: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/04/amazon-flies-24-million/">Amazon's \$23 Million Book</a></blockquote><p>---</p><h2>3. The Developer Who Deleted His Entire Company</h2><p>In 2016, a developer working on a Linux server accidentally executed the following command:</p><pre><code>ash
rm -rf /
</code></pre><p>That’s bad enough — but he also did it with <b>root privileges</b> and on a production server <i>without proper backups</i>. The command recursively deletes everything on the system, starting from the root directory. His cloud provider couldn’t help: the data was gone.</p><p>His company, which offered hosting services, lost everything in seconds. The developer wrote a blog post titled <i>"How I deleted my entire company"</i>, and it quickly went viral as a cautionary tale.</p><blockquote>Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/">The Developer Who Deleted His Company</a></blockquote><p>---</p><p>Even in a world of high-tech systems and automation, small mistakes — or a lack of coordination — can still lead to million-dollar failures. Let these stories be entertaining reminders that in tech, humility and backups go a long way.</p></div></article>
