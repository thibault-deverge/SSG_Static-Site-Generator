# From 42 to Full-Stack Development

![42 logo](/images/42.png)

Hi, I'm Thibault — a full-stack web developer trained at [École 42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/), an intensive and peer-led programming school built on autonomy, resilience, and project-based learning.

At 42, there are no teachers, no traditional courses — just real-world coding challenges tackled through collaboration and experimentation. Over the course of the program, I went from writing memory-safe C libraries to deploying full-stack applications with authentication, real-time features, and containerized services. This experience not only shaped my technical foundation but also taught me how to learn fast, adapt, and ship working software under pressure.

## Why 42?

- Peer-to-peer learning: progress through collaboration, not instruction
- Real projects: every milestone mimics real-world development
- Autonomy: you manage your time, your work, and your learning
- Resilience: it’s intense — and that’s the point

42 isn't just a school, it's a professional bootcamp that shapes developers ready for real challenges.
